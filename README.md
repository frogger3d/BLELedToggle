# BLELedToggle

Windows 10 (original version, no update) UWP app to toggle a Bluetooth Low Energy led. Due to restrictions in the Bluetooth API of the original W10 SDK it is not possible to pair with the Bluetooth device in code. You need to pair from the settings panel.

The Arduino 101 code that implements the BLE service is copied from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Genuino101CurieBLEButtonLED
